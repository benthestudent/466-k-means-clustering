New Tasks: (add tasks here if they come up)





Ben
DONE -create Mushroom class
-nominal distance method
-cluster evaluation method to determine density and if clusters are good enough

Daksh
DONE -read/process in data
DONE -store data as arraylist of Mushroom objects
DONE -some way to combine the distances (http://www.econ.upf.edu/~michael/stanford/maeb4.pdf - last few pages explain)
-f1 score method

Filip
DONE -euclidian distance method
-main method
-k-means clustering alg method -> fills hashmap with clusters
DONE -create Cluster class - contains arraylist of mushrooms, centroid, findDensity

Notes:


Euclidean Dist:
    - For qualitative features using one hot encoding -> euclidean dist 0 if match, 2 if not matching
    - Using softmax function to normalize data
